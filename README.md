# Handwritten-digit-detection


We created a neural network with one hidden layer capable of detecting hand written digits(0-9). We also used the ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex relationships between the inputs (pixel densities) and outputs (class probabilities).<br/>


We defined some utilities like get_default_device, to_device and DeviceDataLoader to leverage a GPU if available, by moving the input data and model parameters to the appropriate device.<br/>
